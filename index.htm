                <h1>My Why</h1>
                <strong><small>This site will morph from a motivation to a insparation</small></strong>
                <p>I dream of the day I will wake up, turn off my fan that drowns out the noise at night and walk to my computer to clock in for work. I'm not sure where I will be living but it wont really matter. So this site will serve
                    as a map to where I am going and why I want to get there. 
                    <aside>To start, this page will be my reminder of why I started this journey. We must always start with the why. A soldier will die if he knows his why. Keeping our why in front of us will give us strength when we are weak,
                        it will give us belief when their is doubt, it will force us to break the walls that would have otherwise stopped us! 
                    </aside>
                    <br>
                My why is my family. My wife and son are my life and I would be lost without them. My wife reminds me the past is the past and it will only define us if we let it. We all have become who we are because of our past but nothing in
             our past can hold us back. She supports me no matter how crazy the idea might be. We have been through so much together and she is the reason for everthing good in my life. She pushes me to be a better husband, father and man
             because her belief in me knows no limit. She is my soulmate and I will be telling the world how lucky I am for the rest of my days. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                Then there is my son, my little buddy. He is growning so fast and I know he already gets upset when I call him my "little" buddy. Since the day he was born I knew he was going to be someone special. And I knew I was going to 
            push myself to grow if I was going to be his role model. It is my job to protect him but more then that it is my job and responsibility to show him he is so much more then he believes he is. I saw the greatness in his eyes from the 
            very first moment I held him in my arms. He gives me a fire inside that instills belief that I can do so much more then I believe I can. Because I cannot let him down. I know the feeling of a father who does not fight for his son and
            my son will not feel that pain. I will fight for him till my last breath and I know we will both be better men because of it.</p>

                <h1>Why Coding?</h1>

                <p>Do you believe in fate? <i>The Matrix</i> may only be a movie but I cannot help but think of the similarities between what the world is and what it is becoming. There is more happening in a world we cannot see, then in the
                 one we can. We may not be able to see it but it is very real and the longer we choose to ignore it, just as in the movie, the more we will become slaves to it. But in this world the power is held by those who choose to take the
                red pill and join the ranks of those fighting to improve humanity. 
            <br>
            <br>
            One night not long ago, my wife and I were trying to make a plan of how we could spend more time together. We knew the only answer was to find a work from home job. My wife already has a remote job and homeschools our son. In our
            search there were a lot of software positions open. A quick search on recruiting sites revealed how in demand coding jobs are with great starting pay. Then I looked up what it would take to land one of these jobs and to my suprise, bootcamps are becoming more
            popular. These jobs are much more complex then the hard labor I was use to and the companies seem to care more about if you can actually do the job rather then where you went to school. So we looked up best bootcamps and landed on 
            Coding Temple! It only took Kevin about 8 minutes in the intro video where he stated if I was there because I wanted a higher paying job then I was in the wrong place! I had to pause and think about what he was really saying. Still
            definitly give me a good laugh now lol. At the end of the day I chose coding because I knew it would be a skill that would serve me the rest of my life and something I could teach my son. The tech industry is only going to grow 
            and the need to learn coding will increse as the years go on.

                <strong><small>What does success look like and why its important to me.</small></strong>
                <p>Success means different things to different people. Success to me is finding a job that pays more then my current job with the ability to work from home. I have two huge reasons for this goal... my wife and son. They are 
                my life. I know its strange to hear these days but I really enjoy spending time with my wife. She is my best friend and I want to be home so we can enjoy our lives together.
